This project analyses King County housing data, to provide information for potential buyers and sellers. Through multilinear regression analysis, we aim to determine what factors affect house pricing in the area.

There are three iterations of the model, adding dummy variables, removing colinear variables, log transforming and scaling the data. After cross validation of the final model, we see that the model is neither underfitted or over fitted, adding confidence that the model is robust and suitable for analysis.

The project concludes with with a number of recommnedations for potnetial buyers and sellers.
